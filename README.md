Kahinah
=======

Kahinah is the QA system for OpenMandriva. It hooks into ABF to retrieve packages that have been recently built and automates the QA portion of the package process (pushing to testing, karma, pushing to updates).

It currently runs only off of sqlite3, and there are plans to migrate it to MySQL in the near future.
