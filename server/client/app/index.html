Whee! I should not code at 2 AM, but here I am, typing away.
Of course, there's also a bunch of other sites open, dedicated to
helping me procrastinate on any work I have to do.

And then there are the numberous ember.js tabs open as I struggle
to figure out how ember.js works. I'm almost certain this will be
a piece of work I will look back at in a year and cringe.

Hopefully my cringe won't be mistaken for a heart attack.
