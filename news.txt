Kahinah is now monitoring openmandriva2013.0. You must use Persona to login. Login is required for karma voting. Thresholds are at 3 and -3 for publication and rejection, respectively.

There is a whitelist in place - the system admin must have you in the whitelist to vote.

Logout is being a bit wonky - if you're having trouble logging out go to a build page and try there (you may have to do it twice or more).
