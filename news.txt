Kahinah is now monitoring openmandriva2013.0. You must use Persona to login. Login is required for karma voting. Currently the thresholds are slightly lower, with 2 required for publishing and -2 required for rejection. Please be aware that they will be increased when Kahinah exits alpha.

Logout is being a bit wonky - if you're having trouble logging out go to a build page and try there (you may have to do it twice or more).
